# Piecewise Linear Regression using neural network


### Motivation

* To cover more issues with simple explanation.

 Relationships that can be explained by linear regression are limited in practice. Polynomial or other complex machine learning models are hard to explain, and could behave extreme outside of the data range. Piecewise linear regression, with flexible number of segments and break points, can be applied to much more problems and still simple to explain.

Some examples of piecewise linear regression applications are linked below:

###  Neural Network Model application

 As a framework to determine piecewise linear regression model, we try to use neural network. The benefit is that we can remove the manual input and let the data decide the number of segments and breakpoints.
